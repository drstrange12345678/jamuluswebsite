Hi

Is it possible to have a DND (Do not disturb" feature??

Reason why:
If we are playing rehersal, all members of the band have fast equipment 
and use the same Jamulus client version (3.8.0). So we are able to 
lower the latency to around 20ms which is very fine. We are all here nearby 
located in south Germany.

But if another intruder meets us in our session, we found, that very often 
this guy is from "another planet" or another part of the earth and so his 
latency is higher (sometimes nwe have 40 until 60ms, what can be recognized.
And he is not familiar with our songs.
So if we stream our songs for a virual concert, we should have miminal latency
and all members of the session should have fast equipment and the same version 
of jamulus. Only in this case a acceptable latency is reachable.
And the songs should be good played due to everybodys home rehersal.
So give us a possibility to make a DND feature to forbit during the stream session
that another user disturbes and makes the latency bad. Please.
We are not against visitors during rehersal but we want to "lock the door" to the 
virual room for making recordings for our fans e.g. in youtube or other streaming
environments. May be as an closed usergroup or with an password for the room 
which can be activated by the master of the meeting in his server? Please, 
I know, its really a hard job but may be its possible to implement this feature?
Or is there already a possibility to do so but I do not know it?
